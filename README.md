# Term-Deposit-Prediction

The Bank of Portugal, collected a huge amount of data that includes customers profiles of those who have to subscribe to term deposits and the ones who
did not subscribe to a term deposit.
This repo contains a robust predictive model that would help
them identify customers who would or would not subscribe to their term deposit in the
future.
Data exploration, data cleaning, feature extraction, and developing robust machine learning algorithms that
would aid them in the department are carried out
